   <h3> Ink Wash Painting</h3>
    <p> Ink and wash painting developed in China during the Tang dynasty(618-907). Wang Wei is generally credited as the painter who applied color to existing ink and wash paintings. The art was further developed into a more polished style during the Song dynasty (960-1279). It was introduced to Korea shortly after China's discovery of the ink. Then, the Korean missionaries in Japan, in helping the Japanese establish a civilized settlement, introduced it to Japan in the mid-14th century.

   <h3> Tools and Techniques</h3>
   <p> The tools that are essential to the art form are called the four treasures: brush, ink, inkstone, and paper. Traditionally, ink was made by grinding an ink stick on a moist inkstone. This method is still favored by many brush painters today. An artist puts a few drops of water on an inkstone, and grinds the inkstick in a circular motion until a smooth, blackink of the desired concentration is made. Prepared inks are usually of much lower quality.

   <blockquote> The painter... put upon the paper the fewest possible lines and tones; just enough to casue form, texture and effect to be felt. Every brushtouch must be full-charged with meaing, and useless detail eliminated. Put toger all the good points in such a method, and you have the qualities of the highest art.<br> Dow, Arthur Wesley (1899)<em> Composition.</em>
